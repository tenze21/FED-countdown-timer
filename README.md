# Frontend Mentor - Launch countdown timer solution

This is a solution to the [Launch countdown timer challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/launch-countdown-timer-N0XkGfyz-). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

*For fun I modified this solution to make a countdown timer for newyear(2025) while keeping the design and all similar to the original frontend mentor challenge.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (start the count at 14 days)
- **Bonus**: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle

## My process
For this project I spend a few days thinking about ways to make the countdown timer work(count down), and making the cards flip. Once I had not the full solution but a starting point in my mind I started coding the design and the script to make the count down and also add the flipping effect to the cards.

### Built with

- I have just used the HTML, CSS and Javascript to build this project.

### What I learned

Like I do from all the other frontend mentor challenges, I learned a lot form this challenge too.
- After doing this challenge, I have got a better understanding of the Javascript `Date object`. I had to spend some time reading about the date object on MDN web docs.
- This challenge has also helped me refresh my knowledge of CSS animations. It was interesting making the cards flip with CSS animation and some scripts.
